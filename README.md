Sensel Morph -> Guitar

The [Sensel](http://www.sensel.com/) Morph is a "pressure-sensitive, multi-touch input device that enables users to interact with the digital world". It has a lot of applications, from multi-touch games to modeling based education. This project is inspired by one of the pre-existing overlays - the Piano overlay - and aims to convert the Morph into a standard 6-string guitar.

Morph raw data (x,y,force) -> string & fret data -> [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
<br>Uses Python.
